I don't feel like actually doing this, because it seems a bit trivial
assuming I am thinking of the question right. You just need to have 
some measure of cumulative unsigned error. (I am assuming the exact 
function is known) You can use mean absolute error or least squares 
method to get a measure of how close the two functions are. If you 
do not know the exact wavefunction, then your approach will be less
trivial, but the same idea can be applied. The error measurement
will go down as more dimensions are added, by setting a limit on this,
you can decide when the change is small enough that you can consider 
your wavefunction exact. (NOTE, this will be dependent on basis. Maybe
a safety net one can apply os to compare the error between the current 
and the one two back, to help with cases where the basis set switches 
between even and odd functions, for example.)
